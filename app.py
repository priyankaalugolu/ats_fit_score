                2. **Relevant Experience** ({st.session_state.weights['experience']}% of total score): Evaluate the relevance of the candidate's work experience to the job description.
                3. **Education and Certifications** ({st.session_state.weights['education']}% of total score): Check the alignment of the candidate's education and certifications with the job requirements.
                4. **Keyword Usage** ({st.session_state.weights['keyword_usage']}% of total score): Look for key terms mentioned in the job description and ensure they are present in the resume.
                5. **Certifications** ({st.session_state.weights['certifications']}% of total score): Evaluate the candidate's certifications in relation to the job requirements.
                6. **Achievements** ({st.session_state.weights['achievements']}% of total score): Highlight any quantified achievements in the resume that match the job description.
                7. **Job Stability** ({st.session_state.weights['job_stability']}% of total score): Assess job stability, such as gaps in employment or frequent job switches.
                8. **Cultural Fit** ({st.session_state.weights['cultural_fit']}% of total score): Check how well the candidate's background aligns with the company's culture and values.

                Provide the following:
                - A detailed ATS Score out of 100 based on the rubric above. Consistency across evaluations is crucial.
                - Validate the contact information (Email, Phone, LinkedIn).
                - Provide a summary of experience and education alignment.
                - List the skills found in the resume and how they match the job description.
                - Highlight any quantified achievements mentioned in the resume.
                - Assess job stability (e.g., gaps in employment or frequent job switches).
                - Explain how well the resume aligns with the job description.
                Ensure the evaluation process is consistent and does not vary between different attempts. Focus on accuracy and providing a fair assessment based on the criteria outlined above.
